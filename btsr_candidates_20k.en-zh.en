( See the entry for `` DDoS : TFN client command '' . ) However , in TFN2k , commands from master to daemon are encrypted and sent at random via TCP , UDP , ICMP , or all three . TFN2K obfuscates the true source of attacks by spoofing IP addresses . In networks that employ ingress filtering , TFN2K can forge packets that appear to come from neighboring machines . All encrypted data is Base 64 encoded . It appears that at the end of every encrypted TFN2K packet there are a sequence of 0x41 's ( ' A ' ) . The exact number of 0x41 's varies , but there is always at least one .
